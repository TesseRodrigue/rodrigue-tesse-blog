English was usefull for me because in winter (2018-2019), I went to Danemark, in Copenhagen. Of course I don't speak danish, so English was for me the only way to speak with people. People there are very good English's speaker, that was very surprising.

Last summer I went to Romania, and then I had the same issue of do not speaking the local language. So I spoke with everyone in English but there, less people are able to speak English so I didn't talk so much compared with Copenhagen.

I've started a book about palaeontology : "Fossils The key to the past" written by Richard Fortey. It's an intresting introduction to paleaontology. I bought it at the Museum of natural sciences of Brussel, I took it because I wanted to learn more about palaeontology and improve my English level.
